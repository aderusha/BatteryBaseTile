# OpenForge Battery Base

Based on the [Torch Wall model from the OpenForge project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2125959), use the negative STL in your slicer to cut out a spot for the battery holder, torch, and a path for the wires to connect them.

## BOM

* [CR2032 coin cells](https://amzn.to/3QD344F)
* [CR2032 coin cell holders](https://amzn.to/469ViVx)
* [3mm flickering LED](https://amzn.to/3FZWHmI)
* [1/8" or 3mm heat shrink](https://amzn.to/3MB7EyY)

## Instructions

1. Use [Torch and battery negative.stl](Torch%20and%20battery%20negative.stl) in your slicer as a negative volume to cut a space in your wall tile and print
2. Print [3mm Torch.stl](3mm%20Torch.stl)
3. Run battery holder leads through printed wall part out to torch cutout, trim to reasonable length to work with, and place a short length of shrink over at least one wire.
4. Push the LED legs through the torch, solder long LED leg to red, short leg to black, and cover at least one joint with shrink.
5. Pull torch into wall and press fit into place.  Press fit battery holder into base bottom, it should be very tight.  Stuff slack wire into wall.
